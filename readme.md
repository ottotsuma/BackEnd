Follow the following steps, if you miss one out it won't work and thats your fault.

Get a windows computer
Clone me
Npm instal (Don't use yarn.)
Get a mongodb account (Costs, maybe.)
Pop a dotenv in there with some details {
    USER
    PASS
}
Seed the database, the script is in the seed file
npm start 
go to the localhost:3000
press buttons like a mad man

Migrations - 
mongo-seeding, if you attach it to your mongo app on your desktop you can run the migration scripts from there. This only works on windows.
